  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech thread is AI getting more capable and more embedded in real workflows, while trust and safety lag behind. As models shift from answering to acting through tools, the main tradeoff is speed and convenience versus unpredictable behavior and weak evaluation. This matters most for developers, platforms, and anyone relying on media authenticity.</div>
