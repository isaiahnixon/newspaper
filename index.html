  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s items point to AI moving from novelty to infrastructure: systems are being monetized, tuned for cost, and pushed into high‑stakes uses, which raises new tensions around trust, privacy, and governance. Researchers are highlighting risks from memorized sensitive data, hidden quality regressions, and benchmark contamination, while real‑world outages and scaled malware show how fragile and adversarial the surrounding ecosystem can be. Regulators and employers are also testing how to classify and oversee fast‑changing tech businesses. For readers, the practical lens is reliability and accountability: what assurances exist before these tools and platforms are relied on for work, health, or safety.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across federal and state government, core systems—elections, immigration enforcement, fiscal policy, public health regulation, and arms control—are being tested by sharper partisan conflict and uneven administrative capacity. The central tradeoff is speed and control versus legitimacy and safeguards, with oversight and standards varying widely across jurisdictions. Voters, migrants, taxpayers, and communities facing contamination risks are most directly affected, shaping near-term policy and compliance choices.</div>

  <h2>Economic News (Past Week)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">This week’s data point to an economy where price pressures are still rising even as consumer spending looks flat.

For households and businesses, the near-term question is whether energy volatility or steadier demand will matter more for costs, inventory decisions, and new business starts.</div>
