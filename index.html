  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech thread is a shift from “building AI models” to building the infrastructure and controls around them: compute and connectivity at massive scale, faster data movement, and product-driven iteration. At the same time, security and trust are becoming the binding constraint, with supply‑chain compromises, disinformation at scale, and attacks that bypass current defenses. For readers, the key lens is which organizations can balance rapid deployment with verifiable provenance and enforceable governance, since that will shape risk for users, developers, and platforms.</div>

  <h2>Montana News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s Montana stories reflect how decisions made in politics and public institutions are increasingly shaping everyday security and affordability. Efforts to limit outside influence in elections and debates over immigration enforcement point to tension between accountability and centralized power. At the same time, military modernization and rising housing costs show how policy choices and market pressure affect local communities, especially lower-income residents and service-dependent regions.</div>

  <h2>Economic News (Weekly)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">This week’s data point to an economy facing mixed signals: consumer prices rose while trade flows worsened as imports grew and exports fell, complicating the inflation and growth picture at the same time. Manufacturing demand improved with higher new orders, but energy costs remain a key pressure point as electricity prices tracked higher fuel inputs and cold-weather reliability needs pulled in costlier generation. Households, manufacturers, and policymakers will read this as a tug-of-war between strengthening demand and energy- and trade-driven price and cost risks.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s governance story shows federal power being tested on multiple fronts: lawmakers using oversight and deadlines to force accountability, courts narrowing how election rules can be implemented, and the executive branch leaning on national-security tools and diplomacy to pursue policy goals. The key tension is speed and control—acting quickly amid tight votes and administrative ambition versus procedural constraints and judicial limits. These shifts most affect voters, federal workers and benefit recipients, and industries tied to strategic materials, shaping near-term decisions on compliance, funding, and international engagement.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
