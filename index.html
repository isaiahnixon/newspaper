  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech stories point to AI moving from demos into everyday use: wider regional rollout, consumer creation tools, and more enterprise deployment. A key tension is that headline benchmark gains still don’t guarantee reliability in real-world, high-stakes settings, driving demand for better evaluation and robustness. In parallel, foundational infrastructure—from long-life storage to open-source capacity—shapes who can build, trust, and preserve what’s created.</div>
