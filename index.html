  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech thread shows AI systems moving from lab novelty to infrastructure that needs governance: attackers are finding new multimodal jailbreak paths, while researchers work on editing models to reduce memorized sensitive data and on detecting quality regressions as systems are optimized. At the same time, business and platform pressures—monetization, service reliability, and bot-scale content access—are shaping incentives and risks. Privacy expectations are also under strain as cloud services demonstrate deeper retention and recovery capabilities than many users assume, affecting consumer trust and legal outcomes. Readers should view these items as tradeoffs between capability and cost, and between safety, transparency, and commercial scale.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across federal and state government, basic functions are being shaped by funding brinkmanship, tighter eligibility rules, and the limits of oversight. A key tension is whether stricter controls and accountability measures improve integrity and safety or instead add barriers and leave gaps when agencies lack resources or clarity. These shifts matter most for voters, migrants, and residents relying on safe water and regulated products, and for policymakers weighing tradeoffs between enforcement, services, and fiscal sustainability.</div>

  <h2>Economic News (Past Week)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Recent data point to a mixed but steady start to the year: prices are still rising month to month while consumer spending is flat and overall sales are only modestly higher. At the same time, inventories are edging up and oil markets are expected to stay well supplied, which could ease some cost pressures even as fuel taxes and fees creep higher in some places. New business applications rebounded, suggesting continued interest in starting firms despite uneven demand signals. For households and businesses, the key lens is whether easing energy inputs and stable inventories offset ongoing inflation in everyday budgets and pricing decisions.</div>
