  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech news highlights an AI industry pushing simultaneously for cheaper, more efficient deployment and for stronger controls on how systems behave and are used. That creates a tension between rapid automation and adoption—especially in sensitive areas like patient interactions and security—and the need for trustworthy safeguards and limits on surveillance. For readers, the key lens is where AI is moving from experimentation into operational workflows and regulated public settings, raising questions about cost, safety, and accountability.</div>

  <h2>Montana News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s Montana-related coverage highlights how community identity is being contested and rebuilt across multiple fronts: recovery after sudden loss, debates over public land access and process, and sharper boundary-setting inside partisan politics. At the same time, economic pieces point to more individuals trying to make small ventures work amid uncertainty. For readers, the throughline is how local decisions—about land rules, political affiliation, and inclusive expression—shape who feels represented and who bears the costs of change.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s governance agenda shows how core functions of the state—budgeting, population measurement, national security commitments, and the civil service—are being pulled into high-stakes political fights. The central tension is between executive flexibility and guardrails meant to keep administration, regulation, and economic management insulated from partisan aims. These moves matter for agencies planning around funding and staffing, communities affected by enforcement and representation rules, and markets watching institutional independence.</div>
