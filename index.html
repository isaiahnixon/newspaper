  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech story centers on AI systems becoming both more capable and more embedded in everyday services, while the security and safety scaffolding around them lags and is being actively tested. As agent-like tools gain privileges to act, run code, and handle transactions, failures around verification, third‑party extensions, and domain-specific reliability become key constraints. Readers should view new product and platform moves through the lens of trust boundaries: who controls execution, what can be indexed or acted on, and what guardrails exist when mistakes carry real-world costs.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s global affairs coverage points to rising pressure on civilian safety and basic rights across conflict zones, migration routes, and tightly controlled political environments.
