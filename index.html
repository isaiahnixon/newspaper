  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech story is the widening gap between rapidly expanding AI adoption and the security and reliability work needed to support it. New attack and error-analysis research highlights how AI systems can be manipulated or fail in ways that affect trust, while broader software and credential infrastructure remains a weak link. For readers, the lens is operational risk: teams deploying AI and modern web features need to weigh speed and capability gains against hardening, transparency, and maintainability.</div>

  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s governance story centers on a stronger push to align federal law enforcement, immigration, public lands messaging, and health communications with presidential priorities, testing the boundary between policy direction and institutional independence. The main tension is between centralized control and checks from states, courts, and civil society.
