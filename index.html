  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech news highlights a shift toward cheaper, faster, and more specialized AI, alongside growing concern about the risks and measurement gaps that come with wider adoption. As models move onto smaller hardware and into coordinated agent setups, competition increasingly hinges on efficiency, safety, and reliable benchmarks. For developers and maintainers, the practical lens is how trust, privacy controls, and interoperability standards keep pace with lower barriers to building and copying advanced systems.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s global affairs signal sharper political polarization and rising security friction, as governments test institutional guardrails at home while managing high-stakes disputes abroad. The tension is between deregulation or crackdowns framed as sovereignty and reform, and the costs these moves can impose on public welfare, rights, and stability. Readers should view this as a shift that affects legal protections, diplomatic leverage, and the risk of escalation for citizens and allies.</div>
