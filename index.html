  <h2>Local News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Montana is seeing a mix of loosening federal environmental guardrails and growing pushback over public-land access and industrial pollution risks.

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Recent developments show courts playing an outsized role in defining the limits of executive power, shaping election rules, and adjudicating disputes over religion in public schools. At the same time, gaps in public-health data sharing and new international coordination efforts highlight how governance also depends on transparency and cross-border standards. For readers, the key lens is which institutions—judges, agencies, states, or partners abroad—are now setting the rules that affect costs, rights, and public services.</div>
