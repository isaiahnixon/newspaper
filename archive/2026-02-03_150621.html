  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech story is a push to embed advanced AI deeper into core platforms and infrastructure, from enterprise data tools to satellite-connected compute. That expansion sharpens tradeoffs between capability and operational risk: software supply-chain attacks, prompt-driven fraud in agent-based payments, and fragility in large-scale serving. At the same time, energy use and resiliency are becoming practical constraints that shape deployment choices.</div>

  <div class="macro-summary">Recent data point to sticky inflation pressures alongside widening external imbalances and uneven momentum in goods-producing sectors. Higher energy-related costs and elevated shipping prices underline how fuel markets and transport capacity can quickly feed through to broader prices and supply chains. For households and businesses, the key lens is whether cost pressures are being offset by demand and production gains, or instead tightening margins and raising import dependence.</div>

Trade and security bargains are increasingly linked, with economic concessions tied to alignment choices in wider conflicts, while fighting continues to damage civilian infrastructure and complicate talks. Meanwhile, limited border access and shrinking aid budgets expose how quickly protection and health services can falter, shaping risks for civilians and governments planning relief and stability.</div>
