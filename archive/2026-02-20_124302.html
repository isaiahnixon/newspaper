  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech news reflects a split between rapid AI expansion and the need to make it dependable. As tools spread into new regions, workplaces, and creative uses, questions about reliability and training data quality become more consequential for real-world outcomes. Readers can view this as a shift from “can it do it” to “can it be trusted, and on what data,” alongside parallel investment in long-term infrastructure like durable storage.</div>

  <h2>Local News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across local governments and institutions, officials are recalibrating how growth is managed—loosening some access controls while raising user fees, pursuing outside funding for major infrastructure, and revisiting how local policy aligns with federal enforcement. The tension is between welcoming demand and covering costs without shifting burdens unevenly. These choices affect travelers, recreation users, commuters, immigrants, and students, and they signal where communities are prioritizing capacity, affordability, and autonomy.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">U.S. governance is being shaped by a mix of high-stakes electoral jockeying, aggressive use of executive authority, and escalating legal battles over regulatory rollback. Abroad, coercive tools—military posture and targeted travel limits—are being used alongside diplomacy, raising the tradeoff between pressure and stability. These moves affect voters, regulated industries, and officials weighing institutional norms against short-term leverage.</div>
