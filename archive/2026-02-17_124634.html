  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s tech story mixes two pressures: using legal strategy and regulation to shape which energy and climate technologies gain traction, and pushing AI toward cheaper training and more personalized behavior. The tension is between accountability and innovation on one side and cost, control, and scaling constraints on the other. These shifts matter for product roadmaps and compliance decisions in energy, mobility, and AI deployment.</div>

  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s developments underscore strain on federal governance as immigration enforcement and oversight become a primary fault line, now severe enough to disrupt core operations and staffing. At the same time, questions about democratic resilience are being pulled into mainstream debate, raising the stakes of institutional brinkmanship. Readers can view this through who bears immediate costs—affected agencies, local communities, and U.S. partners weighing reliability.</div>

  <h2>Economic News (Past Week)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Recent data point to cooling energy costs alongside mixed momentum in the broader economy: prices rose modestly, consumer spending was flat, and new business filings rebounded after a prior dip. The key tradeoff is whether easing fuel inputs offset softer demand enough to support growth without adding inflation pressure. This matters for household budgets, small-business planning, and interest-rate-sensitive decisions.</div>
