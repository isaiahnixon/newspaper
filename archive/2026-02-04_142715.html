  <h2>Montana News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Montana’s latest developments point to a busy stretch of policy and legal conflict, with fights playing out across elections, immigration rules, land and business regulation, and local growth. A common tension is how far government should go in setting guardrails versus leaving outcomes to markets and courts.

  <h2>Economic News (Weekly)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">This week’s data point to uneven momentum: inflation is still rising month to month, manufacturing demand has strengthened after recent softness, and the external balance deteriorated sharply as imports outpaced exports. At the same time, energy costs remained a key pressure, with higher fuel prices feeding into power markets even as new grid connections expand supply options. The main tension is whether firmer demand can coexist with cost and trade headwinds, shaping decisions for manufacturers, energy-intensive businesses, and policymakers.</div>
