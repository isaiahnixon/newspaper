  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Tech coverage is splitting between rapid rollout of smaller, more capable agent-style AI and growing scrutiny of how these systems are released, secured, and governed. New tooling and research emphasize autonomy and coordination, while parallel work highlights data-leakage pathways and reputational risks from weak controls. Meanwhile, advances in energy storage and legal fights over clean-energy competition show how technology progress can be constrained—or accelerated—by regulation and market power, shaping investment and adoption decisions for developers, firms, and policymakers.</div>

  <h2>Local News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across Montana, local decisions are increasingly being shaped by higher-level legal standards, major infrastructure and market shifts, and the practical limits of public capacity. Communities face tradeoffs between individual rights and enforcement authority, preserving neighborhood character while meeting mandated growth, and protecting local interests as outside consolidation and election cycles raise the stakes. Residents, property owners, and service providers are most affected, as these debates guide where housing goes, how public safety is resourced, and how accountability is set.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across governance, today’s items show heightened friction between public security powers and civil rights, spanning elections, immigration enforcement, and official communications. A parallel thread is institutional strain from budget brinkmanship that disrupts basic operations while policy fights continue. Meanwhile, foreign policy is being advanced through security partnerships and energy agreements, shaping priorities and resource tradeoffs. Voters, immigrants, federal workers, and state and local officials are the most directly affected, and the key lens is how accountability mechanisms hold up under pressure.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Diplomacy is proceeding in parallel with continued military pressure, underscoring how negotiations can coexist with escalation rather than pause it. At the same time, security and technology partnerships are tightening, with advanced capabilities and arms sales increasingly shaping external relationships. In democracies, scrutiny over influence and transparency is rising, affecting how governments manage trade outreach and political operations. Readers can view these developments through who gains leverage—combatants at the table, states building deterrence, and institutions trying to defend credibility.</div>
