  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Federal governance is being strained by funding brinkmanship that is leaving a key security agency partly shuttered while immigration oversight remains unresolved. The stalemate reflects a pattern of high-stakes negotiations breaking down under intense political pressure, raising questions about institutional resilience and democratic norms. This matters for communities dependent on federal services and for officials weighing near-term security, staffing, and accountability tradeoffs.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">The items point to a sharper turn toward enforcement and deterrence in foreign policy, alongside a fast shift in Europe toward greater self-reliance as assumptions about security partnerships are re-tested. The tension is between coercive tools and negotiation—especially around nuclear and sanctions disputes—while domestic regulation and defense budgets are being pulled into the same security frame. This matters most for governments and firms managing legal, supply, and security risk across borders, and for households facing tradeoffs between safety measures and costs.</div>
