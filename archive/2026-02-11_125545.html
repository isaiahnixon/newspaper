  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Tech is moving toward more automation and more control at the same time: companies are tightening identity and access rules after sensitive data exposure, while new devices and features aim to broaden adoption across price tiers. Research underscores the tradeoff: AI systems can speed security and computer tasks but can also behave unsafely or unreliably without stronger guardrails. Readers should view this as a shift in how risk, trust, and usability are being balanced for consumers and security teams.</div>

  <h2>Local News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s local items point to communities juggling public safety and institutional accountability alongside the practical demands of growth. A central tension is how quickly systems—from policing and hospitals to housing and development finance—can respond when needs surface suddenly or at scale. Residents, workers, and local decision-makers are most affected as they weigh trust, capacity, and costs in planning and oversight.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Federal governance is being shaped by deadline-driven bargaining that ties core security and immigration operations to contentious conditions, sharpening the tradeoff between enforcement choices and keeping agencies funded. At the same time, courts and congressional oversight are being used more aggressively as checks, with legal challenges and testimony disputes testing transparency and due process. Trade and foreign-policy moves add pressure, affecting border communities, detainees, and planners who need predictable rules to make near-term decisions.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s global affairs coverage points to governments asserting tighter control over borders, territory, and people flows while alliances and institutions strain to respond. The tension is between security and sovereignty claims on one hand, and legal norms, humanitarian access, and economic connectivity on the other.

  <h2>Catholic News (Past 3 Days)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Recent Catholic news highlights the Church operating on several fronts at once: responding to violence against clergy and communities, addressing humanitarian crises that expose the human cost of migration and war, and trying to strengthen accountability through greater transparency on abuse-handling rules.

For readers, the key lens is how leadership balances pastoral support and emergency aid with institutional credibility and governance.</div>
