  <h2>Tech News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Across AI and device security, the trend is toward wider deployment alongside clearer evidence that safety and integrity can change or be subverted through subtle inputs, training dynamics, or adversarial prompting. At the same time, tools are expanding access—both to agent-style coding workflows and to speech systems for underserved languages—raising the stakes for trustworthy behavior and evaluation. Readers should view this as a tradeoff between faster adoption and the need for stronger, verifiable protections and accountability for who can inspect, control, or unlock systems.</div>

  <h2>Montana News</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Recent Montana-linked developments point to government institutions being pulled into higher-stakes legal and administrative disputes, from elections and citizenship rules to water allocation and public land management. The tension is between state control and federal authority, with courts and compliance processes increasingly setting outcomes. Voters, students, and water users should read this as policy choices being shaped less by local debate and more by litigation timelines and intergovernmental demands.</div>

  <h2>Economic News (Weekly)</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">This week’s data point to an economy where price pressures and higher energy input costs remain relevant even as manufacturing demand shows some resilience. At the same time, a widening external gap underscores how shifts in domestic spending and cross-border flows can quickly change the growth mix. Regulators are keeping bank buffers steady while they test downside risks, a reminder that financial stability remains a constraint alongside inflation and activity.</div>

  <h2>U.S. Governance</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s governance story is defined by a push-and-pull between keeping core federal functions running and intensifying fights over who controls elections, district lines, and immigration enforcement. Courts and lawmakers are becoming key arenas for settling partisan and federal–local disputes, while accountability gaps for federal officers and contractors raise questions about oversight. Voters, migrants, and workers are directly affected, and public opinion is increasingly polarized.</div>

  <h2>Global Affairs</h2>
  <div class="macro-summary">Today’s global affairs signal a widening gap between diplomatic engagement and deteriorating security and humanitarian conditions. Multiple negotiation tracks are still moving, but they sit alongside rising strategic instability as key arms-control limits lapse. At the same time, worsening hunger underscores how conflict and governance breakdowns quickly translate into life‑threatening needs. Readers should view this as a test of whether diplomacy and aid reform can keep pace with escalating risks for civilians and broader regional stability.</div>
